## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* tensorflow/tensorflow-gpu
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* imbalanced-learn (0.4.3)

## Dataset
We evaluated our model using [the PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database](https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/)
* To download our pre-processed datasets use [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19bDrAqlSGQuNLRmA-7pQRU9R81gSuY70?usp=sharing), then put them into the "data" folder.
* Or you can follow the instructions of the readme file in the "data preprocessing_Matlab" folder to download the MIT-BIH database and perform data pre-processing. Then, put the pre-processed datasets into the "data" folder.

## Train

* Modify args settings in seq_seq_annot_aami.py for the intra-patient ECG heartbeat classification
* Modify args settings in seq_seq_annot_DS1DS2.py for the inter-patient ECG heartbeat classification

* Run each file to reproduce the model described in the paper, use:

```
python seq_seq_annot_aami.py --data_dir data/s2s_mitbih_aami --epochs 500
```
```
python seq_seq_annot_DS1DS2.py --data_dir data/s2s_mitbih_aami_DS1DS2 --epochs 500
```
